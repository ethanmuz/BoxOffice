# Box Office

This Java application is a box office simulator, as requested by CHESS Health for me to demonstrate my programming competency.

## Functionality

The box office counts ticket sales for five (5) movies that will be shown in theaters at this movie theater. The Movie Database (MovieDatabase.txt) contains the information for each movie, including the movie name, number of tickets sold, and total number of tickets available. Before each day of sales, the Box Office may swap movies in to be shown in theaters.

Once the day begins, customers may purchase tickets for each of the movies, as long as there are enough tickets in stock. At the end of the day, the program gives the Box Office owner a report for each movie: how many tickets were sold out of how many were available.

This application runs via command line right now, and all usage instructions are provided to the user throughout the duration of the program.

## What doesn't work (yet)

- GUI
- Invalid input

I can add a GUI and handle invalid input better in the future, if requested.
